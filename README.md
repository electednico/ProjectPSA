# ProjectPSA
My group project in Power System Analysis

To run the program just open the files and run main.
In main you can change the case of the outage on no line, line 2-3, line 2-5 and line 3-5.
Q-limit can also be set in the main.
In the files for the different Ybus the shunt can be added by changing the shunt variable from false to true.

The SequenceMatrix and the AugmentedZbus files must be run by themselves.
